## Hi, everyone! üëãüèº

My name is Chris. I am 29 years old & a passionate open-source developer who loves to travel the world, learn about new cultures & eat good food.

In case I am not traveling the world, I live in Los Angeles, CA. At the moment, though, my wife and I (+ our two dogs, Buddy & Lulu) are traveling for a couple more months. So, if you ever want to meet up, let us know‚Äîwe would love to swing by for a drink/snack‚Äîno matter where in the world!

Currently, we are spending a lot of time in & around Germany because that's the part of the world I was born and raised. It's incredible showing my wife (who is from LA) my old "stomping grounds."

In my "free time," I love Open Source development, like working on the Stacks & Meema ecosystems.

Your support and sponsorship mean a lot to me!  ‚ù§Ô∏è

### A few highlights

- [Stacks](https://github.com/stacksjs/stacks) - A full-stack framework powered by Vite, deeply inspired by Laravel & Vue.js.
- [Meema](https://github.com/meemalabs) - Media & file management with ease‚Äîfront & backend
- [Open Web](https://github.com/ow3org) - Where web2 ingenuity meets web3 mindset. A decentralized community that develops progressive, open web standards, and stacks.

### My current focus

Aside from core Stacks development, these are the stacks we will finish next:

- [Table](https://github.com/ow3org/table-stack) (Q3 - Data tables with ease)
- [Command Palette](https://github.com/ow3org/command-palette) (Q3 - `cmd + k` for the web)
- [Date Picker](https://github.com/ow3org/date-picker-stack) (Q3 - Beautiful, modern date picker)
- [File Manager](https://github.com/ow3org/file-manager-stack) (Q3 - Build your own file manager‚Äîlike Dropbox or Google Drive)
- [Image](https://github.com/ow3org/image-stack) (Q3 - Modern image experience)
- [Video](https://github.com/ow3org/video-stack) (Q3 - Modern video experience)
- [Audio](https://github.com/ow3org/audio-stack) (Q3 - Modern audio experience)
- [Web3](https://github.com/ow3org/web3-stack) (Q3 - Solana support, cross-chain core _Ethereum & Cardano drivers coming._)
  - [Wallets](https://github.com/ow3org/wallets) (Q3 - Wallet Authentication)
  - [NFT](https://github.com/ow3org/nft-stack) (Q3 - NFTs, Candy Machine mechanisms, and more.)
  - [DeFi](https://github.com/ow3org/defi-stack) (Q4 - Cross-chain DeFi engine, including staking support)
  - [DAO](https://github.com/ow3org/dao-stack) (Q4 - Powerful toolkit for DAO governance)

Timelines, in all likelihood, will change a lot but you may use those as indications of priorities.

Would love to hear from you & get to know you!
