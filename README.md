## Hi, everyone! 👋🏼

My name is Chris. I am 30 years old & a passionate open-source developer who loves to travel the world, learn about new cultures & eat good food. When I am not traveling the world, I live in Los Angeles, CA.

### A few highlights

- [Stacks](https://github.com/stacksjs/stacks) - A modern full-stack framework.
- [Open Web](https://github.com/ow3org) - An inclusive community that develops progressive, open web standards, and stacks.
- [Meema](https://github.com/meemalabs) - File & media management with ease—front & backend.

### Current Focus

_Stacks v1.0_, _Stacks 1.x_ and _Stacks 2.x_.

Connect with me here, on Discord, or on Twitter—I would love to hear from you!

_Oh, and say hi to [Buddy](https://www.instagram.com/somebuddyspecial/), the partner in crime!_
