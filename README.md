## Hi, everyone! üëãüèº

My name is Chris. I am 29 years old & a passionate open-source developer who loves to travel the world, learn about new cultures & eat good food.

In case I am not traveling the world, I live in Los Angeles, CA. At the moment, though, my wife and I (+ our two dogs, Buddy & Lulu) are traveling for a couple more months. So, if you ever want to meet up, let us know‚Äîwe would love to swing by for a drink/snack‚Äîno matter where in the world!

### A few highlights

- [Stacks](https://github.com/stacksjs/stacks) - A full-stack framework powered by Vite. _Deeply inspired by Laravel & Vue.js._
- [Meema](https://github.com/meemalabs) - Media & file management with ease‚Äîfront & backend
- [Open Web](https://github.com/ow3org) - Where web2 ingenuity meets web3 mindset. A decentralized community that develops progressive, open web standards, and stacks.

### My current focus

Aside from core Stacks development, these are the stacks we will finish next:

- [Table](https://github.com/ow3org/table-stack) (Data tables with ease)
- [Command Palette](https://github.com/ow3org/command-palette) (`cmd + k` for the web)
- [Date Picker](https://github.com/ow3org/date-picker-stack) (Beautiful, modern date picker)
- [File Manager](https://github.com/ow3org/file-manager-stack) (Build your own file manager‚Äîlike Dropbox or Google Drive)
- [Image](https://github.com/ow3org/image-stack) (Modern image experience)
- [Video](https://github.com/ow3org/video-stack) (Modern video experience)
- [Audio](https://github.com/ow3org/audio-stack) (Modern audio experience)
- [Web3](https://github.com/ow3org/web3-stack) (Solana support, cross-chain core _Ethereum & Cardano drivers coming._)
  - [Wallets](https://github.com/ow3org/wallets) (Wallet Authentication)
  - [NFT](https://github.com/ow3org/nft-stack) (NFTs, Candy Machine mechanisms, and more.)
  - [DeFi](https://github.com/ow3org/defi-stack) (Cross-chain DeFi engine, including staking support)
  - [DAO](https://github.com/ow3org/dao-stack) (Powerful toolkit for DAO governance)

Timelines, in all likelihood, will change a lot but you may use those as indications of priorities.

Connect with me here or on Twitter. I would love to hear from you & get to know you!

_Oh, and say hi to [Buddy](https://www.instagram.com/somebuddyspecial/), my bestie & partner in crime!_
