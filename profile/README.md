## Hi, everyone! üëãüèº

My name is Chris. I am 29 years old & a passionate open-source developer who loves to travel the world, learn about new cultures & eat good food.

In case I am not traveling the world, I live in Los Angeles, CA. At the moment, though, my wife and I (+ our two dogs, Buddy & Lulu) are traveling for a couple more months. So, if you ever want to meet up, let us know‚Äîwe would love to swing by for a drink/snack‚Äîno matter where in the world!

Currently, we are spending a lot of time in & around Germany because that's the part of the world I was born and raised. It's incredible showing my wife (who is from LA) my old "stomping grounds."

In my "free time," I love Open Source development, like working on the Stacks & Meema ecosystems.

Your support and sponsorship mean a lot to me!  ‚ù§Ô∏è

### A few highlights

- [Stacks](https://github.com/stacksjs/stacks) - A full-stack framework powered by Vite, deeply inspired by Laravel & Vue.js.
- [Meema](https://github.com/meemalabs) - Media & file management with ease‚Äîfront & backend
- [Open Web](https://github.com/ow3org) - Where web2 ingenuity meets web3 mindset. A decentralized community that develops progressive, open web standards, and stacks.
